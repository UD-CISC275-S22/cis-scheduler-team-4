Drawing on theories of culture, rhetoric, and social criticism, we will examine media’s role in telling the story of sports and, in telling that story, shapes cultural values. Students will study several critical approaches to sports and public discourse and will apply those approaches to journalism, public relations, the news and popular media, and other forms of mass communication.",

This course works to answer that question by analyzing racism as a problem that’s deeply em-bedded in Western societies, albeit similarly prevalent in many non-Western countries. We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has oper-ated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we’ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.",

In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women’s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism.

We’ll also look at how racism connects with other social categories such as Indigeneity, gender, sexuality, disability, religion and class. And in addition to considering how racism has operated to oppress, exclude and scapegoat, we’ll also be attentive to how marginalized groups have fought back.",

What can we learn from indigenous peoples, social movements, and intentional communities whose values and practices offer alternative visions for how to organize human-environment relations?

In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them.

We approach law as a system of rules, obligations, and procedures. We also understand it as a cultural practice and moral regime. We ask: how are law, politics, and economics enmeshed and with what consequences? How does law provide tools for both social struggle and social control? How does anthropology contribute to our understanding of these issues? To answer these questions, we combine readings from classical legal anthropology with recent writings and other media produced by anthropologists, journalists, and activists working across the globe.

In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women’s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism.

In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

In doing so, this course surveys the multitude of Black women’s experiences and perspectives across class, region, and time. We will move both chronologically and thematically as we explore core themes such as labor, motherhood, sisterhood, sexuality, resistance, respectability, and political activism.

Reproduction is a topic and experience that cuts across multiple political and personal issues: it is at once a deeply intimate and highly public process with implications for both individuals and societies. In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",
